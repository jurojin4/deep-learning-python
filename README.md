# Deep Learning Python

This repository contains all my implementations in the field of **deep
learning** using Python as the programming language. However my goal, as future
AI engineer/AI researcher, is to use or develop mathematical tools in order
to provide solid explanations in this field, where many results are empirical.

My Vision of Artificial Intelligence align with the logic of this paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02540/"><u>The Expressive Power of Neural Networks: A View
from the Width</u></a>.
